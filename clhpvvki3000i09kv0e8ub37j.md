# ‚öôÔ∏è Introduction

A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific point in the history of the project. This allows us to work on different parts of our project without affecting the main branch. And when we finished working on a branch, you can merge it back into the main branch.

* The branch is an independent flow of Development.
    
* If we create multiple files and commit them, then they are committed to the **Master Branch**.
    
* **Master Branch** is the Default Branch in Git.
    
* Generally, the project‚Äôs Source Code is placed on the Master Branch.
    

# ‚öôÔ∏è Need Of Creating A Branch

Suppose, we are working on a project. And we‚Äôll be going to create multiple files. All the files created will be on the **Master Branch**.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684174891354/96055e68-de57-4cd4-8ef0-f348821e1180.png align="center")

We created several files and made several **Commits** to develop a Web Application as per the Client‚Äôs requirement.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684174964733/ac8affde-636c-4645-94bd-7c3b37210b1f.png align="center")

While working on the **Master Branch** to develop the web application, suddenly the client asks for Android compatibility also.

So, for that Android compatibility, we need to do some extra work.

And now we don‚Äôt want to mess up the new code (Android) with the previous code that we were working on for the web application. That work will continue as previously.

For the new feature (Android compatibility) whatever the client is expecting we‚Äôll create a separate new **Branch**.

So, we‚Äôll create a new **Child branch** ‚Äúchild branch-1‚Äù, and on that branch, we‚Äôll be developing all the Android compatibility work.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684175109861/dd0aa0fc-2912-4c5b-bf03-942a91e5f8b2.png align="center")

So, now whatever will be our regular flow, won‚Äôt be affected because of the client‚Äôs new requirement.

If we want, we can commit and push the Source Code that is on the **Master Branch** to the **Remote Repository** without touching the **Child Branch**.

And we can push the **Child Branch** as a separate Branch to the **Remote Repository**.

Or we can merge the **Child Branch** with the **Master Branch** and then **Commit** the update to the **Remote Repository**.

**Note: Master Branch** is generally used for the main flow and **Child Branch is for the** new features.

Suddenly the client asks for IOS compatibility also. So, we‚Äôll create another **Child Branch** named ‚Äúchild branch-2‚Äù. And on that branch, we‚Äôll be developing all the IOS compatibility work.

**Note:** Each Branch is **Independent / Isolated** from each other.

Now, we are having 3 Branches and all of them are Independent of each other.

There are a total of 3 flows of development. At any point in time, any flow can be committed to the **Local Repository** and we can push the changes to the **Remote** **Repository**. There is no dependency on other branches.

**Note:** Total things will be performed on the **Master Branch** unless and until we didn‚Äôt create a new **Branch**.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Advantages Of Branching

**Parallel Development**: We can work on different parts of our project without affecting the main branch. This is especially useful if we are working on a large project with multiple people.

**Organize Source Code in a clean separated way**: We can create a branch to track a bug or issue. This allows us to work on the bug without affecting the rest of our project.

**Work Independently i.e. Isolated from each other**: We can test new features or changes without affecting the main branch. This is a great way to make sure that our changes work before you merge them into the main branch.

**Q.** Suppose we‚Äôll have a separate workspace for the IOS Development, so how will it be different from the branch?

**Ans:** If we‚Äôll maintain a separate workspace for the IOS Development then a separate **Repository** will be required. So, in future, if we have to merge the workspace with the main **Workspace**, then we are required to do it manually.

Space wastage won‚Äôt be there. And everything will be performed automatically by Git if we go for the separate **Branch** instead of a separate **Workspace**.

**Note:** All the files, commit whatever there are in the **Master Branch** by default will be available to the **Child Branch**. All the files, commits etc will be Inherited from the **Parent Branch** to the **Child Branch**.

**Example:**

If we create a **Child Branch**, from the **Master Branch** then all the files, commits etc. will be **Inherited** by the **Child Branch**. But after that, if we create more files on the **Master Branch** then it‚Äôll not be going to reflect on the **Child Branch**.

Once we complete our work in the **Child Branch** then, we can merge that **Child Branch** to the **Parent Branch** and then we can **Commit**. Or we can push the changes on the **Child Branch** to the **Remote Branch** directly.

There are no restrictions for creating the number of **Branches**. We can create ‚Äún‚Äù branches.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Various Commands Related To Branching

Here are some of the commonly used commands related to branching in Git:

## üè∑Ô∏è To View The Available Branches In The Repository

**Syntax :** `git branch`

**Example:**

If we will check the branches in the **Workspace** project1, then we‚Äôll use the command `git branch`

It‚Äôll show only one **Branch** (**Master**).

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684176496068/f1077764-1d1f-46c8-adc0-c67f15a9b88b.png align="center")

*‚Üí* *The symbol* ***Star*** (\*) indicates the current **Active Branch**. This means, currently on which Branch we are working.

## üè∑Ô∏è To Know Which Branch We Are Currently Working On

**Syntax:** `git status`

**Example:**

If we want to know which **Branch** we are currently working on, then we‚Äôll check the status of the Git. It‚Äôll tell the **Branch** **Name**. Try to use this after committing the files.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684176737463/b19ed102-707e-439d-8b17-a942616eb389.png align="center")

**Note:** To know on which Branch we are working then we can use either of the two commands:

* **git branch** (**\* symbol** will indicate the **Active** Branch).
    
* **git status**
    

## üè∑Ô∏è To Create A New Branch

**Syntax:** `git branch <branch name>`

**Example:**

If we want to create a new branch ‚Äúandroid‚Äù then we‚Äôll use the command: `git branch android`

A new branch named ‚Äúandroid‚Äù will be created.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684176938960/3c194d97-1f25-40db-a328-026f631a3ca9.png align="center")

To confirm that we can use the command `git branch`. It‚Äôll display all the branches in that repository.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684177028495/9c806f4d-7e9b-4ab3-bf2b-5491c5ff29e9.png align="center")

Now, there are two branches available in the Repository. And there is a star symbol (**\***) before the **Master**, which means the current Active Branch on which we are working is the **Master Branch**.

## üè∑Ô∏è **Switching The Branches**

**Syntax:** `git checkout <Name of the branch on which you wanna switch>`

**Example:**

If we want to switch from the **Master Branch** to the **android Branch** we‚Äôll use the command¬†`git checkout android`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684177204120/12cb2fd3-1df7-4567-aa29-3e0139e9608e.png align="center")

It is telling ‚Äú **Switched to branch 'android'** ‚Äù. To confirm it, we can use the command¬†`git branch`

Now the current Active Branch on which we are working is the **android Branch** as the star symbol (**\***) moves to before (in front of) the **android branch**.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684177310573/57901ddc-9172-45c1-8ad0-3b2770903891.png align="center")

We can use the command `git status` as well. It‚Äôll be telling ‚Äú**On branch android**‚Äù.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684177465581/791de593-2cce-4702-9a2b-fb4f9cc4ec70.png align="center")

## üè∑Ô∏è Creating A Branch And Switch To That Branch

We can do it using 2 lines of commands. But we can do it using a single line of command.

**Syntax:** `Git checkout -b <Branch name to be created>`

**Example:**

If we have to create a new Branch **ios** and then switch to this branch from the other branch then we‚Äôll use the command :  
`git checkout -b ios`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684177673837/2c51e64e-02fd-4dd4-b05b-7e7b1b8198c7.png align="center")

It is telling ‚Äú **Switched to branch 'ios'** ‚Äù. Now, To confirm it, we can use the command `git branch`

Now the current Active Branch on which we are working is the **ios Branch** as the star symbol (**\***) moves to before (in front of) the **ios master**.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684177821043/e36b44cb-9932-48fd-8f10-1329bf69880c.png align="center")

We can use the command `git status` as well. It‚Äôll be telling ‚Äú**On branch ios**‚Äù.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684177855125/6b858966-efcb-4bcc-844f-dbfcd443a30c.png align="center")
